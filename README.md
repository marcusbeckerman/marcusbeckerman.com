## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to be a personal blogging website, and also a hub that contains links to my profiles on github, linkedin, etc. I'm going to use this website to post blogs about projects I create, technologies I'm interested in, and whatever else I feel like, really.

## Requirements
This website was created using a Python 3 backend framework called Flask.
